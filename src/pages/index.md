  JSEAM is the nickname of Joshia Seam who's a try-hard at being cool. He is
  writing this in 3rd person because he is socially awkward. If you ever find
  JSEAM at your party it's because he accidentally wandered there. Just say hi,
  he won't bite, but he'll engage you in a conversation about some really
  abstruse topic that he's interested in but you aren't. Deal with it.
